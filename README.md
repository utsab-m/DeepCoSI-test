# DeepCoSI test
This repository is a modified fork of DeepCoSI, originally developed by Hongyan Brian et al. as described in:

Du H, Jiang D, Gao J, Zhang X, Jiang L, Zeng Y, Wu Z, Shen C, Xu L, Cao D, Hou T, Pan P. Proteome-Wide Profiling of the Covalent-Druggable Cysteines with a Structure-Based Deep Graph Learning Network. Research (Wash D C). 2022 Jul 21;2022:9873564. doi: 10.34133/2022/9873564. PMID: 35958111; PMCID: PMC9343084.

All credit for the original DeepCoSI framework goes to the authors. This fork is maintained by Utsab Mondal as part of research conducted under Dr. Hisham Daoud in the AIM Lab (Artificial Intelligence in Medicine Laboratory), where we are exploring enhancements to covalent site prediction and model generalization.
